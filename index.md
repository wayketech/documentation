# Wayke technical documentation

## Available documents
The documentation is currently split into two documents: One explaining the Wayke IFrame Implementation, and one explaning the Wayke REST API.

Wayke IFrame Implementation is a simpler integration into using data from Wayke, but doesn't give the same amount of control or functionality as Wayke API.

This page, and the documentation, will be updated with more information in the near future.
