# Wayke technical documentation

The documentation will be updated continuously going toward the first release of Wayke.

## Available documents
The documentation is currently split into two documents: One explaining the Wayke IFrame Implementation, and one explaning Wayke API.

Wayke IFrame Implementation is a simpler integration into using data from Wayke, but doesn't give the same amount of control or functionality as Wayke API.

- [wayke-documentationResellerAPI-V-0-1.pdf](wayketech.github.io/docs/api/wayke-documentationResellerAPI-V-0-1.pdf)

This page, and the documentation, will be updated with more information in the near future.
